## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Guide

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or higher
- Google account with access to Google Cloud Console
- Telegram account (no bot token needed!)
- Basic familiarity with command line
- ~50MB of disk space

### Step 1: Basic Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tg-stats-dashboard-bot.git
cd tg-stats-dashboard-bot

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/MacOS
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Telegram Configuration

#### Getting API Credentials
1. Visit https://my.telegram.org/apps
2. Log in with your phone number
3. Create new application if you don't have one
4. Save your `api_id` and `api_hash` - you'll need these later

#### Creating Session String
This is a bit tricky but super important - we need to create a special session string that lets the bot access Telegram using your account:

```python
# Run this in Python console
from telethon.sessions import StringSession
from telethon.sync import TelegramClient

api_id = 123456  # Your api_id here
api_hash = "your_api_hash_here"

with TelegramClient(StringSession(), api_id, api_hash) as client:
    print(client.session.save())
```

You'll be asked to:
1. Enter your phone number
2. Input the verification code sent to your Telegram
3. Provide 2FA password if enabled

Save the long string that's printed - this is your session string!

### Step 3: Google Sheets Setup

#### Creating Google Cloud Project
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project (or select existing)
3. Enable Google Sheets API:
   - Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Library"
   - Search for "Google Sheets API"
   - Click "Enable"

#### Setting Up Service Account
1. Go to "IAM & Admin" > "Service Accounts"
2. Click "Create Service Account"
3. Fill in the details:
   - Name: e.g., "tg-stats-bot"
   - Role: No role needed
4. Click "Create and Continue"
5. Click "Done"
6. Find your new service account in the list
7. Create key:
   - Click on the service account
   - Go to "Keys" tab
   - "Add Key" > "Create new key"
   - Choose JSON
   - Download the file (keep it safe!)

#### Preparing Google Sheet
1. Create a new Google Sheet
2. Share it with the service account email (found in your JSON file)
3. Copy the sheet URL - you'll need it for configuration

### Step 4: Environment Configuration

Create `.env` file in the project root:
```bash
TELEGRAM_API_ID=your_api_id
TELEGRAM_API_HASH=your_api_hash
TG_SESSION="your_session_string"

# Channels to track - format is important!
TELEGRAM_CHANNELS={"channels":["https://t.me/channel1","https://t.me/+invite_link2"],"chats":["https://t.me/chat1"]}

# Google configuration
GOOGLE_SHEET_URL=your_sheet_url
GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_PATH=path_to_your_downloaded.json

# Other settings
TIMEZONE=Europe/Moscow
MODE=regular  # or 'backfill' for historical data
```

Pro Tips:
- For private channels, use invite links in the TELEGRAM_CHANNELS config
- Make sure you're a member of all channels/chats you want to track
- Keep your credentials file secure - never commit it to git!


## üìä Output & Data Structure

The bot creates several sheets in your Google Spreadsheet, each serving a specific purpose:

### channels_daily
```
Key columns: channel_id, date
Data: channel_name, member_count, messages_count
Updated: Daily rewrite
```
Is used to store current total number of members and messages. Does not store history (yet).

### channel_messages
```
Key columns: channel_id, message_id, word
Data: message date, normalized words
Updated: Every run
```
Great for content analysis:
- Most used words
- Topic trends
- Content patterns
- Language analysis

### chat_topics_hourly
```
Key columns: chat_id, topic_id, hour
Data: topic_name, message_count, first/last message IDs
Updated: Hourly aggregation
```
Perfect for forum-style chats:
- Topic popularity
- Discussion peaks
- Activity heatmaps

### hashtags_detailed
```
Key columns: channel_id, message_id, hashtag
Data: usage date, hashtag text
Updated: Every run
```
Track hashtag performance:
- Popular tags
